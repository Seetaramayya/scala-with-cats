# Scala With Cats

I am writing notes to myself when I am reading book called [scala with cats](https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/). 
cat word is too much over loaded so I have changed model data from `Cat` to `Person` 
 

# Chapter 1 (Introduction)

 - Type classes
 - Cats Show
 - Cats Eq
 - Variance
